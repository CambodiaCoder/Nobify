# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Authentication and Authorization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement signup/login with JWT in Fastify and protect API routes; manage auth state in frontend.
# Details:
In backend, register fastify-jwt plugin, create /auth/signup and /auth/login endpoints, hash passwords with bcrypt, sign JWT tokens, and add auth preHandler to protected routes. In frontend, create React Context for auth, store token in HTTP-only cookie, and wrap protected pages with auth guard.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test auth endpoints for success and failure cases. Integration test protected endpoints reject unauthorized requests. Frontend tests simulate login flow and auth guard behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Backend JWT Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up JWT authentication infrastructure on the backend
### Details:
Configure JWT secret keys, token generation, validation middleware, and token refresh mechanisms. Implement token expiration settings and secure storage of JWT secrets in environment variables.
<info added on 2025-05-21T17:03:14.804Z>
Initial exploration reveals that JWT secret keys are pending definition in the .env file. The fastify-jwt library (v4.1.3) is installed but not yet registered in backend/src/index.ts. Immediate next steps involve defining JWT_SECRET and JWT_REFRESH_SECRET in the .env file, followed by registering the fastify-jwt plugin in backend/src/index.ts using these environment variables.

Completed initial Backend JWT Configuration:
- Added JWT_SECRET and JWT_REFRESH_SECRET to the .env file (with placeholder values).
- Imported and registered the fastify-jwt plugin in backend/src/index.ts.
- Configured fastify-jwt to use the JWT_SECRET from environment variables.
- Added a check to ensure JWT_SECRET is defined, exiting if not.

Token generation, validation middleware, and refresh mechanisms are out of scope for this initial setup and will be addressed in subsequent subtasks (e.g., 3.2 for endpoints, 3.4 for auth middleware).

## 2. User Authentication Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create backend API endpoints for user authentication
### Details:
Implement registration, login, logout, and password reset endpoints. Set up secure session cookies for the Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern. Configure CORS and security headers for all authentication routes.

## 3. Password Security Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement secure password handling on the backend
### Details:
Set up password hashing using bcrypt or Argon2, implement password validation rules, salt generation, and secure password reset flows. Create mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks and implement rate limiting.

## 4. Authorization Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create role-based authorization middleware for backend routes
### Details:
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) middleware that validates user permissions for protected routes. Create functions to authorize different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) and handle unauthorized access attempts.

## 5. Frontend Authentication Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement authentication state management in the frontend application
### Details:
Set up authentication context/store to manage user state. Implement login/logout UI components, session persistence, and automatic token refresh. Create interceptors for authenticated API requests and handle authentication errors.

## 6. Frontend Route Protection [done]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Implement protected routes and authorization guards in the frontend
### Details:
Create route guards to prevent unauthorized access to protected pages. Implement conditional rendering based on user roles and permissions. Add redirect logic for unauthenticated users and handle session timeouts gracefully.
